From direct observation of the certification (post--software-development) and accreditation
(pre-installation) testing of cross domain systems used for the interconnection of classified
security domains in U.S.\ and U.K.\ defence and intelligence community systems, certain
characteristic behavioural patterns have been noted.  The savvy developer
can use these to exert a measure of control over the duration and cost of certification testing
and to predict the likely direction and magnitude of the residual risk calculation performed
by security accreditors in multi-lateral, multi-level, collateral, and compartmented site
accreditations.  DCID 6/3, Common Criteria, DIACAP, and ICD 503 testing efforts across the
evolution of a long-lived cross domain software development programme were examined using
grounded theory methodology.  Whilst discovered through investigation of classified cross
domain system testing inefficiencies, it is believed that the principles are applicable more
widely to privacy-sensitive areas such as electronic health care, financial, and law enforcement
record keeping systems.  The first thing found was a syndrome of pathological regressive
interactions amongst software developers, managers, independent verification and validation
contractors, penetration testers, and certification authorities that resulted in schedule
slippage during the certification testing phase and, in the accreditation phase, ineffective
duplication of testing with no corresponding improvement in residual risk.  To understand why
these problems occurred, an abstract model of how security accreditors agree upon the true
level of residual risk in multi-level cross domain system installations was developed.  The
model is powerful enough to handle collateral, SCI, and international cross domain systems
with any number of endpoints.  It works by establishing the visibility of threats,
vulnerabilities, and mitigations from each data owner's perspective according to the
associated accreditor's clearance over the space of all possible multi-level configurations,
then identifying the smallest set of covert-channel--like information flows necessary to
reach a concord about residual risk without violating the global security policy.  Conventional
wisdom holds that security rules should be strictly enforced, but it is shown that under present
regulations, some desirable information flows are inhibited and other undesirable information
flows are forced.  Paradoxically, it is sometimes the case that relaxing the rules actually
improves security.
