% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

\section{Author Biography}

Joe Loughry received the B.A.\ degree in mathematics from the University of Colorado,
Boulder in 1986 and the M.S.E.\ degree in software engineering from Seattle University
in 1996.  He is currently a Ph.D.\ student in computer science at the University of
Oxford \cite{Loughry2012b}.  He did some of the first research on compromising optical
emanations and holds U.S.\ patent 6,987,461 on countermeasures.  His research interests
include cross domain systems, security certification and accreditation testing,
penetration testing, side channels, and efficient enumeration of subsets.
